Description: 
    Provides tools to simulate and analyse datasets of social interactions 
    between individuals using hierarchical Bayesian models implemented in Stan. 
    Users can generate realistic interaction data where individual phenotypes influence 
    and respond to those of their partners, with control over sampling design parameters 
    such as the number of individuals, partners, and repeated dyads. The simulation 
    framework allows flexible control over variation and correlation in mean trait 
    values, social responsiveness, and social impact, making it suitable for research on 
    interacting phenotypes and on direct and indirect genetic effects (`DGEs` and `IGEs`). 
    The package also includes functions to fit and compare alternative models of social 
    effects, including impact–responsiveness, variance–partitioning, and trait-based 
    models, and to summarise model performance in terms of bias and dispersion.
