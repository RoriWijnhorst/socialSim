Description: 
    Tool to simulate and analyse datasets of social interactions 
    between individuals using hierarchical Bayesian models implemented in Stan. 
    The package includes functions to simulate social phenotypes with direct 
    and indirect effects, fit alternative IGE models (e.g., impact-responsiveness, 
    variance-partitioning, and trait-based models), and summarise model performance 
    in terms of bias and dispersion.
