**Simulate and Analyse Social Interaction Models**

The **socialSim R package** provides tools to simulate and analyse datasets of social interactions between individuals using hierarchical Bayesian models implemented in Stan.

It enables users to generate realistic social interaction data, where individual phenotypes influence and respond to those of their partners. The simulation framework allows control over variation in **mean trait values, social responsiveness, and social impact**, making it suitable for research on **direct and indirect genetic effects (DGEs and IGEs)** and **interacting phenotypes**.

The package also provides analysis functions to evaluate model performance in terms of bias and dispersion, using both established and novel approaches to modelling social effects, including impact‚Äìresponsiveness, variance‚Äìpartitioning, and trait-based models.

## üß≠ Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("RoriWijnhorst/socialSim")
# Then load the package:
library(socialSim)
```



## ‚öôÔ∏è Example workflow:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(socialSim)

# 1. Simulate data
sim <- simulate_data(
  ind =1200,
  partners = 4,
  iterations = 100,     # number of datasets created    
  B_0 = 1,              # population intercept
  psi = 0.3,            # population-level response
  Valpha = 0.2,         # variance in direct effects
  Vepsilon = 0.1        # variance in residual partner effects
)

# 2. Fit a Stan model
res <- run_model(sim, model = "Trait.stan", iter=5000, cores = 6)

# 3. Summarise results
summary <- summarise_results(res)
print(summary)
```
